# A-Real-Time-CNN-Model-for-Plant-Identification-using-CNN
 Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  to classify different plant species based on images
# ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Plant Classification ðŸŒ±  

This project utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify **30 plant species** based on images. Built using **TensorFlow**, the model processes input images, predicts the plant species, and achieves high accuracy.  

The trained model is integrated into a **Streamlit web app**, enabling users to upload an image and receive real-time predictions. This project is designed to support applications in agriculture, plant research, and biodiversity studies.
